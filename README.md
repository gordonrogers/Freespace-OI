Optical Interconnection Architecture for AI, robotic vision and motion control and general highspeed communications
Previously unpublished graphic from my UC Berkeley DARPA work
The United States Patent & Trademark Office published a file November 10, 2016 that follows up on a registered patent in my name on the same subject and with the same title that issued July 17, 1986. The patentable enhancement makes possible multiple uses of the same optical frequency during a given time period in a ‘computer’. It supports Open Control and Software Defined Architecture communications and allows for arbitrarily high internal clock speeds that scale with available optical Ethernet bandwidths. Additionally, this is a neuromorphic architecture with spatial analogs to the thalamus, corona radiata, cortex and corpus callosum, although radially symmetric. Further advantages of the approach include: Speed of light interconnection, highest possible packing density, massively parallel processing with no more unstable and tedious precision fiber alignments or dense cable harnesses. It has scalable bandwidth, cache-coherency, is compact, rugged and inherently E-M shielded and is internet protocol compatible with standard physical interface for easy maintenance & upgrade, and it may support quantum computing because of its naturally exact synchronization.- It is a mirror-based line-of-sight system wireless network that is performance/cost effective, and is perfect for AIs, brain modeling, robotic vision systems and motion control, hyper-fast & strong personal computing, server-farm analysis/control, smart UAVs and AVs, satellites, space probes, and time-optimal for general engineering and physical system modeling.
